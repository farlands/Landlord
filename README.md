Landlord
========

Landlord is a Bukkit server plugin built to prevent griefing, stealing, and harm to animals in a simple manner.

Purpose
---------
Landlord is purpose-built to keep the Minecraft experience simple and fluid for players while also protecting their land. This plugin can protect player builds with minimal gameplay interference, while also allowing players to tweak their land protection details to their preferences.

Functionality
---------------
Players claim land partitioned by chunks for a configurable cost. Claiming a chunk is all a player needs to do to protect their builds within that area. Each claimed chunk will have a very basic permissions system that users can choose to tweak with but also not touch if it isn't desired.
